* take phonetics into account, i.e., convert to some phonetic representation,
  such as International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), and only then apply
  the Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance

* give extra weight for present but unmatched names, esp. initials,
  vs missing (rationale: incorrect)

* improve gender differentiation, increasing weight for name "suffix",m
  e.g., Adriano vs Adriana should differ more than Adriano vs Adreano.

* improve performance, concentrating on improving asymptotic time and space
  complexities
